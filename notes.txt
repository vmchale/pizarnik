(at this point `just already has something on the stack... anyway a `just -- a ; `nothing -- `nothing we *do* expand... but we then when `nothing unifies with a on the right, it propagates to the left, and suddenly the focus prevents generalization (if it gets generalized I guess that can be passed back? unify on right first...)
